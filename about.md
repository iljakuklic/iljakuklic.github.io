## About me

Hi, my name is Lukáš. I am a software developer currently based in Edinburgh, Scotland.
I enjoy computer science, in particular reading papers on programming language theory,
poking various type systems, compiler design, GPU/accelerated computing,
solving optimization problems and more. Sometimes I dive a bit into games programming,
signal processing, graphics programming, or artificial intelligence.
I am particularly interested in using concepts from maths, logic and theoretical computer science
to solve real-world problems.

Besides that I like beer, whisky, travelling, music, economy and some more stuff that
does not immediately come to my mind.

Hopefully, this is enough to give you a glimpse of what
kind of content might this blog be eventually filled with.

## About this website

The source for this website on GitHub [here][sitesrc].
It uses [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/),
a static website generator written in [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/).
Actual conversion of posts written in markdown to HTML is performed by [Pandoc].
All the beautiful styling is due to [Pure CSS] framework;
all of the ugliness are my modifications to it.
Several JavaScript libaries have been imported to enhance the browsing experience:
[prism.js] for code syntax highlighting, [MathJax] for math typesetting.
I employed my finest [Gimp] prowess to create the *heap of brains*
artwork you can see in the side bar.
