title: Hello, Internets!

This place is going to be a storage space for [my](/about.html) ideas and thoughts.
Unorganized and messy. Sometimes looking more like it was written by a random
bad pun generator rather than a human being.
Containing a weird mixture of small hidden gems (I hope there will be some eventually)
and a heap of toxic and otherwise dangerous or at least utterly useless material
(pretty sure about this).

Welcome to *Braindump Junkyard*.

### What I intend to write about

These are some of the likely areas of the future posts:

* various topics from the domain of computer science
    + programming languages, programming models and type systems
	+ functional programming
	+ compiler design
	+ pretty much anything, really
* travelling around Scotland (and elsewhere)
* my music discoveries
* an occasional rant about politics (I promise to keep this at bare minimum.)

I hope the range of themes relatively diverse to be relatively diverse. We shall see...

### What is missing

Here is a list of website features I might add in the future
as the need for them arises and/or if there is enough popular demand:

* blog posts in categories
* blog archives
* RSS feed
* support for comments (if you want it, write a comment)
* anything else?

### That's it for today!

See you soon.
